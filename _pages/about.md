I am a postdoc in [Tamara Broderick's](https://tamarabroderick.com/) group at the MIT [Laboratory For Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/). Previously, I was a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Professor Carl Edward Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/). I am interested in spatial statistics, validation methods for non-i.i.d. data, Gaussian processes and approximate Bayesian inference.
