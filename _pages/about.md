I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I am supervised by [Professor Carl Edward Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/) and advised by [Professor Richard E. Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/). My research has been mostly in the area of approximate Bayesian inference. I am particularly interested in variational inference and scalable Gaussian process regression.
