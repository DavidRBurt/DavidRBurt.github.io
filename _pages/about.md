I am joining [Tamara Broderick's](https://tamarabroderick.com/) group at the MIT [Laboratory For Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) as a postdoc in August 2022. Previously, I was a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Professor Carl Edward Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl/). My research has been mostly in the area of approximate Bayesian inference. I am particularly interested in variational inference and scalable Gaussian process regression.
